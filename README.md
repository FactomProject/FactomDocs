NotaryChains create a Protocol Stack for Bitcoin 2.0 applications.  NotaryChains construct a simple, standard, effective, and secure foundation for Bitcoin 2.0 style applications.  Bitcoin provides a "ledger of record" where hashes for a NotaryChain server can provide proof of record for its own record of entries. At the most basic level, NotaryChains provide "Proof of Exisence."  Any digitial artifact can be reduced to a signature that proves its existence at a point in time.

NotaryChains extexnd this idea.  Each notary chain in the system provides a "Proof of Process."  Proof of each step in a process can be entered into a "notary chain" of provable events.  One obvious sort of notary chain is a log.  A security cammera can log a stream of signatures, proving video was taken at a point in time, and that the video has not be altered.  A Coin is also a process, one proving that coins existed and were exchanged.  The the steps in processing a title for Real Estate is a process, and one where the documentation can prove decisive in court.  

Notary Chains are constructed from entries crafted to support a wide range of applications.  An entry can be used to prove data existed at a point in time.  And other notary chains and demonstrate their reaction to such data.  In other words, a notary chain is a sequenct of entries that define some progression of state, and the data that drove that progression.  Each notary chain has its own rules, and entries in these chains are constrained by those rules.  

The architecture for NotaryChains allows for the easy construction of tokens or coins, securities, smart contracts, etc.
